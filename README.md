# webconnect

A library wrap simple api for data exchange between frontend and backend.

Currently in very early stage. The aim is to greatly simplify and accelerate small app's development. This repo would be divided into js part and golang part, and able to run on your own computer.

Now working on:

- middleware support
- a so-called dataDump middleware
- connect lose problem, reconnect
- authorization middleware
- cache middleware
- realtime communication solutions
- repeat promises' lazy fullfill
- many ideas...

The library will have a Javascript frontend and a Golang backend support at beginning. More backends and server-to-server interaction might be taken into consideration after the main features becoming stable.
